      "Vs. Protoss": "Can outrange Colossus, but Disruptor is the exact opposite. Nevertheless Liberators are needed to force your opponent transit into Carriers or Tempests. Disruptors don't kill aircrafts, after all. Needs +2 Weapon to two-shot Stalkers (one-shot with EMP).",
      "Vs. Terran": "Vikings on paper have every advantage over the Liberator, except speed. Do not blindly produce Liberators against Terran. Often used as a reinforcement for Siege Tank (1-2) pushes; keep enemy Viking numbers in mind.",
      "Vs. Zerg": "Killed by three Ravagers using Corrosive Bile. With Marines and Marauders the counter-composition usually involves Banelings, so Siege Tanks are normally preferable for the early to mid-game. Production of Liberators is usually to reinforce the other side of the map when the enemy is using more expensive units like Hydralisks or Ultralisks where Liberators can get their full value. This is also entirely a player preference."
